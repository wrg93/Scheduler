# Scheduler
In this application the calendar is sychronized via date()constructor. I use the retrieved data to set the correct attribute for my hours as linked to the CSS page ("past", "present", "future").

I gave each button id's and save the text based on event listeners for each button. The text is then stored and retrieved, respectfully, from localStorage.
